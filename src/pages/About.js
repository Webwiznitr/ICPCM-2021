            The Department of Metallurgical and Materials Engineering, National
            Institute of Technology Rourkela is going to organize the 3rd
            International Conference on Processing and Characterization of
            Materials (ICPCM–2021) and 11th National Conference on Processing
            and Characterization of Materials (NCPCM–2021) during 7th-8th
            December 2021 after successful completion of earlier conferences in
            this series. “Processing and Characterization of Materials” is a
            foremost topic of interest for most of the researchers in the
            scientific community. Advanced processing and characterization
            techniques make it possible to develop many novel materials for
            different applications including nuclear reactor, aerospace, defense
            and other structural sectors. Technological advancement urges novel
            design of fabrication strategy, comprehension of structure-property
            relationship for the sustainability in application of the
            components. The objective of the conference is to highlight all the
            technological advancement in the area of processing and
            characterization of materials. The conference is expected to attract
            the researchers, scientists, practicing engineers from various R & D
            organizations, academic institutions, and industries at a single
            platform. The interdisciplinary approach of the conference may allow
            the participants to look beyond their areas of research and
            expertize. The organizers of the conference contacted distinguished
            researchers to deliver keynote and invited lectures on processing
            and characterization of materials. The conference is expected to be
            a platform for young researchers of the globe to share their
            research, network with eminent peers of diversified fields,
            industry-institute collaboration. Senior practicing engineers,
            established researchers, and faculty members will also get an
            opportunity to share their knowledge and information.
